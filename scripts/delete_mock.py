?WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES???
The script deletes mock(fake) data what had been created for testing/development purposes.
!It will be extremely useful for deploying the project


Mock data(fake data) - data for testing current app to see functionality during real work
A word 'mock' and 'fake' have the same meaning in the context of the scipt. 

Suplier - A bonus suplier. E.g. Online-casino, Betting company, CS:GO app, Poker room .......whatever
A word 'casino' and 'suplier' have the same meaning in the context of the scipt. 


?POSSIBLE ARGUMENTS:
! The order of arguments is not important

all -- removes all mock data(casinos/supliers,bonuses). Default argument.
bonus -- removes mock Bonus data(all testing bonuses)
casino -- removes mock Suplier data(all testing casinos/supliers)

NO ARGS -- if you does enter any argument. The script executes with default 'all' argument.
           it will remove all mock data(casinos/supliers,bonuses).


?HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT:
python manage.py runscript delete_mock
delete_mock is the script 


?Exmples of using the scipt for solving real-world issues: 

1) Deleting all mock data(casino, bonuses....)
python manage.py runscript delete_mock --script-args all
or
python manage.py runscript delete_mock --script-args


2) Deleting bonus mock data
python manage.py runscript delete_mock --script-args bonus


3) Deleting casino mock data
python manage.py runscript delete_mock --script-args casino
