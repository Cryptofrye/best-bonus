?WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES???
The script creates mock(fake) data for testing/development purposes.


Mock data(fake data) - data for testing current app to see functionality during real work
A word 'mock' and 'fake' have the same meaning in the context of the scipt. 

Suplier - A bonus suplier. E.g. Online-casino, Betting company, CS:GO app, Poker room .......whatever
A word 'casino' and 'suplier' have the same meaning in the context of the scipt. 


FBA(Fake Bonus Amount) argument.
FCA(Fake Casino Amount) argument.



?POSSIBLE ARGUMENTS:
!It takes only integer digits as arugments
! Arguments are positional. So the order is important. 
e.g. 
python manage.py runscript create_mock --script-args 100 10
The line above takes as argument 10 and 100. 100 is FBA, and 10 is FCA

python manage.py runscript create_mock --script-args 10 100
The line above takes as argument 100 and 10. 10 is FBA, and 100 is FCA
! So you should be carefull with that


first argument -- FBA. Removes all mock Bonus data
second argument -- FCA. Removes all mock Suplier/Casino data


?HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT:
python manage.py runscript create_mock --script-args 10 100
create_mock is the script
10 - is first argument. FBA
100 - is second argument. FCA


?Exmples of using the scipt for solving real-world issues: 
1) Creating 100 Mock Bonuses
python manage.py runscript create_mock --script-args 10
10 - is FBA(Fake Bonus Amount) argument

2) Creating 100 Mock Bonuses and 10 mock Casinos
python manage.py runscript create_mock --script-args 100 10
100 - is FBA(Fake Bonus Amount) argument
10 - is FCA(Fake Casino Amount) argument
